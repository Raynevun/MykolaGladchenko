What was done:
- Spent around 3h
- Implemented point #1 from test assignment
- App is runnable from command line
- Implemented few trivial Unit tests (just null verification)
- Implemented few basic rest tests for 1 URI of real REST web service

How to run from console:
- Make sure you have maven and jdk installed
- cd to root folder
- execure "mvn clean install" from command line (this will also run few unit tests)
- cd to ..target folder
- execure "java -jar summarize-beacon-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar". This will run point #1 from test assignment and print output.
